Bayesian Neural Networks:
Probabilistic programming can be used to define Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), where the weights of the network are treated as distributions rather than fixed values. This approach can yield uncertainty estimates for predictions, which is valuable for tasks like medical image classification where a measure of confidence in the classification is crucial.

Hierarchical Models:
Hierarchical probabilistic models can be applied to image classification problems where there is a need to learn from hierarchical and grouped data. For example, classifying images of animals where there is a hierarchy such as species, genus, family, etc.

Few-shot Learning:
Few-shot learning involves training a model on a very small amount of data. Probabilistic programming is particularly well-suited for few-shot learning as it allows you to build models that generalize well from small datasets by incorporating prior knowledge and reasoning about uncertainty.
